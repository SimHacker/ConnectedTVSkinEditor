        listings on a card so they don't take up main RAM memory in your Palm. 
        For example, you can keep your TV listings file in a Secure Digital (SD) 
        memory card or a Sony Memory Stick.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To store your schedule on a memory card, 
        use the file ConnectedTVSchedule.bin (instead of ConnectedTVSchedule.pdb). 
        Download and Save it from your ConnectedTV download page into your 
        computer. There are two ways to get your ConnectedTVSchedule.bin file 
        onto your memory card:</font></p>

        file is not a Palm file type, double-clicking it won't automatically 
        launch the Palm Install Tool the way Palm application (.prc) and 
        database (.pdb) files do. You can start the Palm Install Tool by 
        double-clicking on its icon, or on any Palm .prc or .pdb file. Then, 
        drag and drop the ConnectedTVSchedule.bin file into the Install Tool 
        window. The Install Tool will automatically arrange to put this schedule 
        file in the external memory card. (If you didn't really want to HotSync 
        the file you double-clicked, select and Remove it from the HotSync list 
        before exiting the Install Tool.) Be sure the memory card/stick is in 
        your Palm when you HotSync it, and your TV schedule will be copied to 
        the right folder in it.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Your computer's operating system may 
        allow you to automatically run the Palm Install Tool whenever you 
        double-click a file with a .bin name extension. This can simplify 
        downloading and HotSyncing schedules to your memory card. Be careful 
        about using this feature if you'll be using other files that have the

        typically much faster than HotSyncing the file.</font>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">To do this, you may need to follow 
        instructions that came with your memory card writer. Generally, the 
        memory card or stick's contents will appear on your computer's desktop 
        like a floppy, disk, or CD-ROM drive, so you can drag-and-drop the file 
        there.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">For your Palm Powered device to see the 
        TV listings file on the card, be sure to put it in a folder that lets 
        your Palm to recognize it: a subfolder named Launcher in a top-level 
        folder named PALM on the card. So if your Memory Card/Stick is volume E: 
        on your computer desktop, the file structure should be: <font color="#0000FF">E:\PALM\Launcher\ConnectedTVSchedule.bin 
        </font>Then, remove or Eject the removable memory from your computer, 
        and insert it into your Palm.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Either of these ways will work to get the
