        finger. Most Visor&trade; models have their infrared window on the side.</font></p>        
        <p><font face="Arial" size="2">It's simplest if you can set down the 
        remote control and the Palm with their IR windows facing each other.

        button on your remote control. ConnectedTV is often able to detect the 
        right frequency. If it does not detect it in five seconds, you may have 
        to try different frequencies to see which works best. Press <i>OK</i> to
